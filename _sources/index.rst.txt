functorch
===================================

.. currentmodule:: functorch

functorch is `JAX-like <https://github.com/google/jax>`_ composable function transforms for PyTorch.

It aims to provide composable vmap and grad transforms that work with PyTorch modules
and PyTorch autograd with good eager-mode performance.

.. note::
   This library is currently under heavy development - if you have suggestions on the API or
   use-cases you'd like to be covered, please open an github issue or reach out.
   We'd love to hear about how you're using the library.

Why composable function transforms?
-----------------------------------

There are a number of use cases that are tricky to do in PyTorch today:

- computing per-sample-gradients (or other per-sample quantities)
- running ensembles of models on a single machine
- efficiently batching together tasks in the inner-loop of MAML
- efficiently computing Jacobians and Hessians
- efficiently computing batched Jacobians and Hessians

Composing :func:`vmap`, :func:`grad`, and :func:`vjp` transforms allows us to express the above without designing a separate subsystem for each.
This idea of composable function transforms comes from the `JAX framework <https://github.com/google/jax>`_.
